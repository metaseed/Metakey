;English translation for Clipjump
;first made by Avi Aryan

; NOTES
; Comments should only be at the start of the line
; Add new keys in the future versions at the bottom for easy & consistent development
; Add version no in comment when adding a new key in the translation file.
; Most keys have format XXX_ where XXX is the component name
; Dont translate 'Clipjump'
; & in &Preview is to create shortcut Alt+P when the window is active. When translating into a non-english language, omit '&' and when in a english type language, use '&'
; only when you are sure you are right.
; Words inside %..% are variables. Take them as constants and translate them accordingly.
